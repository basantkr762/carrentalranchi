## 🚨 WHY GMB IS CRITICAL FOR RANKING

Google My Business (GMB) is THE most important factor for local search ranking:
- 🗺️ Shows in Google Maps
- 📍 Shows in "Near me" searches
- ⭐ Shows in Local 3-Pack (top 3 results)
- 📱 Direct calls from search results
- 🚗 Direct directions to your business

**Without optimized GMB = You won't rank locally!**
